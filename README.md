# ZEPTO MOBILE

A UI and mobile framework based on [Zepto](http://zeptojs.com/) and [Backbone](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/). The goal is to reproduce something similar to [jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/) but more lightweight, since the combo Zepto+Backbone is much lighter than jQuery+jQueryMobile.

The target is to target mobile webkit browser first (because of Zepto), and based on Zepto evolutions more mobile browsers.

## Included

* [Zepto.js](http://zeptojs.com/)
* [Backbone.js](https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/) and its dependency, [Underscore.js](https://github.com/documentcloud/underscore)
* [iScroll.js](http://cubiq.org/iscroll-4) (iScroll 4) to allow for fixed header and footer
* [ICanHaz.js](https://github.com/andyet/ICanHaz.js) for templating
* [My fork](https://github.com/DjebbZ/swipeslide/tree/multi) of the [SwipeSlide](https://github.com/max-power/swipeslide) Zepto plugin to allow for multiple slides to be displayed in the slider/carousel. See [the pull request](https://github.com/max-power/swipeslide/pull/1) for details.

Credits to the (abandonned) [Zepto UI](https://github.com/ollym/zepto-ui) for the idea and most of the css.

And special to all the fabulous Javascript community.
